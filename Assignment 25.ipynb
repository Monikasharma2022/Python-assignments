    "# Square Brackets ([]):\n",
    "# When you use square brackets around a list comprehension, Python evaluates the comprehension immediately and returns a list containing the results.\n",
    "# This means that all the elements are stored in memory at once, making it suitable for situations where you need to iterate over the result multiple times or need random access to the elements.\n",

    "# The __next__() method returns the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items, it raises the StopIteration exception.\n",

    "# Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets. They produce values lazily as they are iterated over.\n",
    "# Generators are iterators, meaning they automatically support iteration protocols. They can be used in loops, passed to functions expecting iterators, and so on.\n",
    "# Unlike regular functions, which return a single value and forget their state, generator functions retain their state between invocations, allowing them to resume execution from where they left off."

    "# Generator functions are defined using the def keyword, just like regular functions, but they contain one or more yield statements.\n",

    "# Both map calls and list comprehensions provide ways to transform data by applying a function to each element of an iterable.\n",
    "# map is more memory-efficient as it returns an iterator, while list comprehensions construct the entire list in memory.\n",
    "# List comprehensions offer more flexibility and readability, especially when the transformation involves multiple steps or filtering.\n",
