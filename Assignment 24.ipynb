    "# Syntax:\n",
    "# With a def statement, you define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and its parameters, \n",
    "# followed by a colon (:). The function body is then indented below.\n",
    "# A lambda expression, on the other hand, is a way to create anonymous functions using the lambda keyword, followed by\n",
    "# the parameters and a colon (:), and then the expression to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage:\n",
    "# def statements are used for creating named functions that can be called later in the program using their names.\n",
    "# lambda expressions are typically used for creating small, one-line functions on the fly, often in situations where\n",
    "# you need a simple function as an argument to another function, like in map(), filter(), or sorted().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Capabilities:\n",
    "# Functions defined with def can have multiple expressions and statements within their body. They can also include docstrings\n",
    "# for documentation.\n",
    "# lambda expressions are limited to a single expression. They can't contain statements like return, assert, or raise,\n",
    "# and they can't have docstrings.\n",

    "# def statements are generally more readable due to their explicit nature. They provide a clear function name and allow\n",
    "# for more complex functions with multiple lines of code.\n",
    "# lambda expressions can make code less readable if they become too complex or are used inappropriately.\n",

    "# Designing functions effectively is crucial for writing maintainable, readable, and reusable code. Here are some general guidelines for coding functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Functions should have a single, well-defined responsibility. They should do one thing and do it well. If a function is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive Names: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for your functions that accurately describe what they do. A function name should indicate its purpose or action without the need for additional comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consistent Naming Convention: Follow a consistent naming convention for functions, variables, and parameters. This improves code readability and makes it easier for others to understand your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modularity: Write functions that are modular and reusable. Functions should be designed to be independent of each other and should encapsulate specific functionality that can be reused across your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function Length: Keep functions short and focused. Ideally, a function should fit on one screen without scrolling. If a function is too long, it may be a sign that it's doing too much and should be broken down into smaller functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid Side Effects: Functions should have as few side effects as possible. Minimize changes to global variables or mutable objects outside the function's scope. Functions should ideally only modify their local variables or return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Parameters and Return Values Appropriately: Pass parameters to functions to provide necessary inputs, and use return values to communicate the results of computations. Avoid relying on global variables within functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error Handling: Handle errors and edge cases gracefully within functions. Use exceptions to indicate exceptional situations, and ensure that error messages are informative and helpful for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Document Your Functions: Write clear and concise documentation (docstrings) for your functions, including information about their purpose, parameters, return values, and any side effects. This helps other developers understand how to use your functions correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testability: Design functions with testability in mind. Functions should be easy to test in isolation, which often involves minimizing dependencies and making use of dependency injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid Repetition: Avoid duplicating code by extracting common functionality into reusable functions. This improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consistency with Style Guidelines: Follow the style guidelines of the programming language or the coding standards of your project. Consistent code style improves readability and makes it easier for others to contribute to your codebase."
