    "\n",
    "# Formulas and Functions: Excel supports a wide range of built-in formulas and functions for performing calculations, \n",
    "# data analysis, and manipulation. Users can utilize these functions to automate tasks and perform complex calculations\n",

    "\n",
    "# Data Validation: Excel offers data validation features that enable users to define rules and restrictions for data entry.\n",
    "# This helps ensure data integrity and accuracy by preventing users from entering invalid or incorrect data.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Multiple Sheets: Excel workbooks can contain multiple sheets, allowing users to organize related data into separate tabs\n",
